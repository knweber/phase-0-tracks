What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

	One of the key philosophies of the Linux OS is that it never assumes that the user has no idea what s/he is doing. Whatever you tell it to do, it will do, as it believes that creative solutions may come about from the user making mistakes along the way. Other operating systems may stop a user from doing something or assume that the user is trying to do something else, which would hinder the user's creativity and independence.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

	A virtual private server is essentially a virtual operating system. It is hosted by a larger server which hosts other VPS as well. Advantages to VPS hosting include the ability for the user to host more than one website on the same VPS, the provision of independent server resources for your site (e.g. disk space, RAM). A good analogy I found for VPS hosting likens it to buying a condo, where you own your own space but it is within a larger building that other people live in as well.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

	It's a bad idea because it compromises the integrity of the entire system. The root user has complete access, and so a simple mistyped command may wipe out all directories in the system. By logging in as a different user, you have limited access privileges and thus are less likely to harm the system.
