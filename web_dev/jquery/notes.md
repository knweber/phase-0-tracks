RELEASE 0: Make a Plan
	1. Use Google to read a few definitions of jQuery
	2. Use Google to look for a few simple examples of jQuery being used
	3. Look at Codecademy syllabus for jQuery and make note of the topics covered
	4. Do some initial Googling on each of the topics, just to get a good idea of what they refer to
	5. BREAK!!
	6. Look for a few jQuery cheat sheets to see the commands/syntax used and what jQuery can do for you
	7. Browse through the jQuery section of w3schools to get a better overview
	8. Look for some basic jQuery tutorials and try to solve 3-4 problems

RELEASE 1: Study Up

	Although I followed my plan for the most part, I found that going down mini rabbit holes as I searched through Wikipedia, W3Schools, the jQuery website, etc. was helpful in introducing me to new concepts. I tried to limit these sessions to a few minutes, and doing so generally gave me enough information on the topic to be able to understand the workings of jQuery better. The cheat sheets were not particularly helpful in this case, as they mostly just listed commands with no explanations (or very short ones). I would imagine they would be more helpful for developers already familiar with using the library who just need a reference sheet. I did a few problems through Free Code Camp and that helped me to learn the syntax and understand the multiple ways I could target an element.
