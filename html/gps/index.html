<!--Personal Reflection
1. The purpose of semantic tags is to provide an organizational structure for the webpage. This is especially important for improving the accessibility of webpages, so screen readers can accurately convey content in its intended order to the user. I think the most useful tags in this context would be <header>, <title>, <main>, and <footer> tags, since they seem to be the primary organizing tags.
2. The order that the browser uses to display elements on a page is mostly chronological, beginning with the elements in the heading, moving onto those in the body (including <main> and all <div> sections), and ending with the footer.
3. I loved learning about snippets! At the end, I made a snippet that would populate the code for a table when I type "table[TAB]". I would also like to create a snippet for a form - I could add in all of the basic elements, and then remove or modify them as needed.
4. I think the most difficult challenge was pushing the files that Alex sent me (and which I edited in the second half of the session) up to GitHub. The fact that it came to me in a different folder (i.e. not in my local repo) threw me off a little, but Alex was able to offer some guidance. He helped me work through transferring the files to my own repo, pushing them up to GitHub, and then merging them onto my master branch.
